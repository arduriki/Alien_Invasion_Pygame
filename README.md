# Alien_Invasion_Pygame
Usage of Pygame package to develop a 2D game.

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom
center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the
arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet
of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots
and destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the
player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.
If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

Project based on the book: Python Crash Course 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes
I strongly recommend that book to learn Python basics.
